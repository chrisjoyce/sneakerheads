# Sneakerheads 
👟‍⛹️‍🏀⚽️🏈	

The goal of Sneakerheads is multifaceted. One my side hustles is to resell shoes on eBay. I wanted a way to track
ome information from eBay in order to make my life while searching for shoes in stores significantly easier. This also
allowed me to explose some new technologies that I don't get to use in my day job.
